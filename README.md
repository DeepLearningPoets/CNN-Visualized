Alexnet started the deep learning revolution, it is a very simple model composed by convolution/relu block followed by three big fully connected layers.

Where each colored block (conv block) are convolution followed by a **ReLU**

And each white blocks are just fully connected layer followed by a **ReLU**

## [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
ResNet introduced residual connection in which the input to a block is added to its ouput to boost gradient flow throught the model. They defined two diffent block and stack them together to create different architectures.
